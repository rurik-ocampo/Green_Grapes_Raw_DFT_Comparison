This folder contains the results of comparing the DFT (discrete fourier transform) band pass image processed green grapes object detection model with the image raw green grapes object detection model.

Note that for the image processed data set, each image was transformed into the spatial frequency domain using DFT. Then a modified band pass filter is applied. Afterwards, an inverse DFT is applied.
